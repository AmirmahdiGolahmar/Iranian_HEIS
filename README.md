# Iranian_HEIS
## Introduction
The Statistical Center of Iran (SCI, https://amar.org.ir) has been conducting Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS), formerly known as Household Budget Survey, in rural areas since 1342 (1963-1964), and urban areas as of 1347 (1968-69). In the beginning, it only contained the household expenditures questions; and it was in 1353 (1974-75) that the questions concerning the household income were added to the survey’s questionnaire.

The HEIS aims to hand in estimates of the average income and expenditure for urban and rural households at provincial and country levels. Among many applications, the surveys enable researchers to estimate the household’s income and expenditure composition and distribution patterns, the household consumption pattern, the weight for each commodity in the household consumption basket, also to calculate the poverty line, and study the imparity in household income and facilities.
